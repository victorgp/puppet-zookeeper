[![Puppet
Forge](http://img.shields.io/puppetforge/v/deric/zookeeper.svg)](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/deric/zookeeper) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/deric/puppet-zookeeper.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deric/puppet-zookeeper)

A puppet receipt for [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/). ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.

## Requirements

  * Puppet >= 2.7, Puppet 3.x
  * Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.x
  * binary package of ZooKeeper

## Basic Usage:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper': }
```

## Cluster setup

When running ZooKeeper in the distributed mode each node must have unique ID (`1-255`). The easiest way how to setup multiple ZooKeepers, is by using Hiera.

`hiera/host/zk1.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '1'
```
`hiera/host/zk2.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '2'
```
`hiera/host/zk3.example.com.yaml`:
```yaml
zookeeper::id: '3'
```
A ZooKeeper quorum should consist of odd number of nodes (usually `3` or `5`).
For defining a quorum it is enough to list all IP addresses of all its members.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  servers => ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', '192.168.1.3']
}
```
Currently, first ZooKeeper in the array above, will be assigned `ID = 1`. This would produce following configuration:
```
server.1=192.168.1.1:2888:3888
server.2=192.168.1.2:2888:3888
server.3=192.168.1.3:2888:3888
```
where first port is `election_port` and second one `leader_port`. Both ports could be customized for each ZooKeeper instance.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  election_port => 2889,
  leader_port   => 3889,
  servers       => ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', '192.168.1.3']
}
```

### Observers

[Observers](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.3.0/zookeeperObservers.html) were introduced in ZooKeeper 3.3.0. To enable this feature simply state which of ZooKeeper servers are observing:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  servers   => ['192.168.1.1', '192.168.1.2', '192.168.1.3', '192.168.1.4', '192.168.1.5'],
  observers => ['192.168.1.4', '192.168.1.5']
}
```

### Setting IP address

If `$::ipaddress` is not your public IP (e.g. you are using Docker) make sure to setup correct IP:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  client_ip => $::ipaddress_eth0
}
```

or in Hiera:

```yaml
zookeeper::client_ip: "%{::ipaddress_eth0}"
```

This is a workaround for a a [Facter issue](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/FACT-380).

##  Parameters

   - `id` - cluster-unique zookeeper's instance id (1-255)
   - `datastore`
   - `datalogstore` - specifying this configures the dataLogDir ZooKeeper config values and allows for transaction logs to be stored in a different location, improving IO performance
   - `log_dir`
   - `purge_interval` - automatically will delete zookeeper logs (available since ZooKeeper 3.4.0)
   - `snap_retain_count` - number of snapshots that will be kept after purging (since ZooKeeper 3.4.0)
   - `min_session_timeout` - the minimum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 2 times the **tickTime** (since ZooKeeper 3.3.0)
   - `max_session_timeout` - the maximum session timeout in milliseconds that the server will allow the client to negotiate. Defaults to 20 times the **tickTime** (since ZooKeeper 3.3.0)
   - `manage_service` (default: `true`) whether Puppet should ensure running service
   - `manage_systemd` when enabled on RHEL 7.0 a service configuration will be managed

and many others, see the `init.pp` file for more details.

If your distribution has multiple packages for ZooKeeper, you can provide all package names
as an array.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages => ['zookeeper', 'zookeeper-java']
}
```

## Hiera Support

All parameters could be defined in hiera files, e.g. `common.yaml`, `Debian.yaml` or `zookeeper.yaml`:

```yaml
zookeeper::id: 1
zookeeper::client_port: 2181
zookeeper::datastore: '/var/lib/zookeeper'
zookeeper::datalogstore: '/disk2/zookeeper'
```

## Cloudera package

In Cloudera distribution ZooKeeper package does not provide init scripts (same as in Debian). Package containing init scripts
is called `zookeeper-server` and the service as well. Moreover there's initialization script which should be called after installation.
So, the configuration might look like this:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  packages             => ['zookeeper', 'zookeeper-server'],
  service_name         => 'zookeeper-server',
  initialize_datastore => true
}
```

### Managing repository

For RedHat family curretly we support also managing an yum repo. It can be enabled with `repo` parameter:

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  repo => 'cloudera'
}
```


## Java installation

Default: `false`

By changing these two parameters you can ensure, that given Java package will be installed before ZooKeeper packages.

```puppet
class { 'zookeeper':
  install_java => true,
  java_package => 'openjdk-7-jre-headless'
}
```

## Install

### Librarian (recommended)

For [puppet-librarian](https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet) just add to `Puppetfile`

from Forge:
```ruby
mod 'deric-zookeeper'
```

latest (development) version from GitHub
```ruby
mod 'deric-zookeeper', git: 'git://github.com/deric/puppet-zookeeper.git'
```

### submodules

If you are versioning your puppet conf with git just add it as submodule, from your repository root:

    git submodule add git://github.com/deric/puppet-zookeeper.git modules/zookeeper

## Dependencies

  * stdlib `> 2.3.3` - function `ensure_resources` is required
  * datacat

## Supported platforms

    * Debian 7 Wheezy: available in apt repository
  * RedHat/CentOS/Fedora
